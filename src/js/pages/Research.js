				<h1>Research</h1>
					<p>I work within the Computational Linguistics Group (CLG) in Intelligent Systems at Trinity College Dublin. My funding is from Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), provided via the ADAPT: The Global Centre of Excellence for Digital Content and Media Innovation.</p>
					<p>At the moment, my research area involves developing methods of effectively representing event data for classification and reasoning, in the context of artificially intelligent agents. This means detecting the state of an environment or other situation, and using some logic-based reasoning to make decisions about what actions have taken place in order for the state to have reached its current setting from some previous one.</p>
					<p>My current investigation is into semantic networks, and if/how they can be re-purposed for modelling temporal information, which is crucial to event representation. This node-based network could also be linked with other traditional means of information representation, such as finite state machines, graphs, semantic frames, etc.</p>
					<p>I have previously completed work into areas such as sentiment analysis (specifically, looking at terms which can alter the sentiment/polarity of a sentence) and expressive speech synthesis (creating a synthetic voice system, capable of switching between different emotions in realtime speech by composing several voice style which emulate human expressions and characters).</p>
					<p>I am interested in most areas of artificial intelligence, and how it can be used to improve our daily lives, particularly through the use of natural language processing. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to my work, as well as using them more creatively. The use of AI in the web is something I would like to explore further. I also have an active interest in historical linguistics and language evolution, as well as how this can affect automatic language systems.</p>
